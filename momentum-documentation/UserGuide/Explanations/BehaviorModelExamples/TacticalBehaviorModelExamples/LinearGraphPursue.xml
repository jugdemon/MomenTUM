	<!-- The linear Graph Pursue model is a simple wayfinding model. -->
	<!-- It finds all next navigation nodes (vertices) that are visible. -->
	<!-- It will then check which of these nodes are regarding the angle 
		 vertex - pedestrian positions - heading (unit vector) is the smallest. -->
	<!-- This vertex will be used as next goal -->
